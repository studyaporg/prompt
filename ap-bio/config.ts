Stimulus should also include diagrams and models,such as cells and processes of certain occurences, such as photosynthesis. Experimental scenarios including hypothesis should be utilized, and should allow the students to either figure out whether it was wrong or right, and figure out improvements on it. Reading passages should be used as well.",

        "The FRQs should consist of generally two types: long free-response questions and short response questions. The questions consist of explaining,identifying, and predicting what goes on or will happen in the stimulus shown. There should be questions that also require the students to justify a certain action or solution done based off the stimulus. Some of the frqs should also require the students to calculate a numerical value, utilizing algebra and arithmetic. Finally, some questions should have students hypothesize what will happen based off information given in the stimulus.",
